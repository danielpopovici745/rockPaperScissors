Hello! This is my first project with JavaScript and its a first to 5 wins of Rock, Paper, Scissors. 

Initially this project only included the game in the browser console  but now I have added a ui into the webpage for the user to play against the computer. Went for a darmode theme. Hope you enjoy!
